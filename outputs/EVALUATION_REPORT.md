4. Complete the AI research module implementation
5. Add robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls
6. Implement input validation and rate limiting
7. Add logging and monitoring capabilities
8. Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

**💰 Cost Estimate**: $50-150/month depending on research frequency and Claude API usage

### 4. ui-ux-audit-tool: 6.8/10 ❌ FAIL

**Score Breakdown**:
- Token Efficiency: 6/10 ⚠️ (1 file >500 lines)
- Code Quality: 7/10
- Architecture: 8/10
- Production Readiness: 6/10
- Business Value: 7/10

**🚨 Critical Issues**:
- File size violation: dist/test-execution/heuristic-handlers.js at 625 lines exceeds 500 line limit
- Missing comprehensive test coverage for core audit functionality
- No error boundaries or graceful degradation for AI service failures
- Potential Claude API cost explosion without rate limiting or usage monitoring

**✅ Strengths**:
- Well-structured modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- TypeScript implementation with proper type safety
- Multiple report types providing comprehensive UI/UX analysis
- Integration with established tools (Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse)
- Clear CLI interface with flexible command options
- AI-enhanced analysis adds significant value over basic auditing tools

**💡 Recommendations**:
1. **PRIORITY**: Refactor heuristic-handlers.js into smaller, focused modules under 500 lines
2. Implement comprehensive test suite covering audit workflows and AI integration
3. Add rate limiting and usage monitoring for Claude API calls
4. Implement fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable
5. Add input validation and sanitization for URL processing
6. Create detailed documentation for each report type and interpretation
7. Add configuration options for API usage limits and cost controls

**💰 Cost Estimate**: $50-200/month depending on audit frequency and report complexity
